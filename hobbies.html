                <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <p> 
                        My interests are basically anything that has to do with art, activity, and mental stimulation! My personality is that of an introvert. I tend to be quiet,
                        observant, and curious. I have found great interest in different forms of art and literature, and think that it has been a major influence on my life. A big 
                        interest of mine is drawing. I usually spend a good amount of time on my projects, and sometimes they turn out very well! Another Interest for me is reading.
                        Though i don't read very often, I always find it an enojyable experience to be able to dive right into a book and let the imagination run wild! In addition,
                        I love to travel. One of my favorite places to go is the mountains, where it's peaceful and captivating. Another place i love to travel to is the beach. Me 
                        and my family would always take a trip down to Florida for the summer to enjoy the sun and surf, so it holds a special place in my life!
