                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                 <p>Back in 2017 I had taken a computer science course at my university. It revolved around building web pages and understanding basic computer concepts.
                By the end of the semester, i managed to create my own webpage but for the next several years i didn't revisit computer science. I then discovered
                Treehouse and a newfound interest in front and back end web development! Ever sine i was a kid, technology always fascinated me, so growing up with
                computers i became somewhat familiar with how they operate, but not quite tech savvy. I am currently pursuing a postion as a junior web dev in the next
                year as i work on my techdegree to help me acquire the skills that i need to become job ready.

                <h2>My Work History</h2>
                <p>My first job was in the athletic department at my university as a student worker. I continued to work at the football and basketball games
                    until i found my most recent job as a server at a hotel. I still have these two jobs and plan to stay there until i move forward in my
                    computer science career. Roles i am most interested in exploring are in:
